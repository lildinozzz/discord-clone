Key Features of the Project

1. Secure User Authentication
   Sign-In and Sign-Up: Users can securely log in or sign up via Clerk.
   After signing in or signing up, users are automatically redirected to the appropriate page.
2. User Profile Management
   Users can create and manage their profiles after signing in.
3. Server Management
   Create and Join Servers: Users can create their own servers or join existing ones through invitations.
   Channel Management: Each server can have both text and voice channels.
   Roles and Permissions: The server features a role-based permission system (e.g., admin, member) with different access rights.
4. Real-Time Communication and Syncing
   Text Chat: Channels support real-time messaging with message syncing between users.
   Voice and Video Calls: Powered by LiveKit, users can engage in real-time voice and video calls in dedicated rooms.
   Push Notifications: Users receive notifications for new messages and mentions.
5. Database Management with Prisma & PostgreSQL
   Prisma ORM: Type-safe queries for interacting with PostgreSQL.
   Structured data for users, servers, channels, and messages.
   Efficient Data Management: Optimized for large-scale data handling and performance.
6. File Uploading
   File Uploads: Users can upload files (e.g., images, documents) to the platform.
   Integrated with UploadThing for managing and storing files.
